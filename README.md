# Poké-Find
## Description
You are able to search for any Pokémon that you want to find out more about inside of the search. Once you do this, a list of the pokémon’s base stats will appear, as well as its corresponding pokemon card right next to it. At this point, the user is presented with the ability to save the card to their virtual deck if they choose to. Then, there is another button which will redirect you to another page where all of the cards that you saved will be displayed onto the page as a visual representation of your chosen virtual deck. The user is also presented with the ability to clear their virtual deck and start over from scratch if they choose to, and they can click another button that will redirect them back to the homepage where they can search for new pokemon again.
